# DPM
Dynamic Population Model

This repo contains all items that relate to the DPM for GBADs.

Currently the Testing directory has been created and contains the 
templates for the original cattle scenarios designed by Gemma and Wudu.
The poultry and small ruminants scenarios will be added soon.

Much more to come...
